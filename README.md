# NBA-2017-Quick-Game-simulation
In this project, I implemented a NBA 2017 quick game with JSP, Servelt in Java and connected MySQL with Jdbc. In this game, player can choose a team with favorable lineup to fight with other team. All the result generated by the game is simulated based on the real ability of athletes in NBA 2017 season. The abilities of athletes are stored in Database at the beginning. And the match result will also be updated into database after the match is finished.
